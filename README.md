<!---# Quick Introduction
---

Hi, My name is Sri Immani, I am an ML enthusiast and aiming to work as an AI Engineer. My tech stack revolves around core python, ML frameworks such as Pytorch and tensorflow, Javascript, web frameworks such as ReactJS and typescript for frontend. I am currently learning how to build RAG systems from scratch with custom LLM's using open source LLM's. To achieve that I am actively learning prompt engineering and ML system design concepts. I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at Case Western Reserve Univeristy focusing on Generative AI tools for Education. As a part of my job role I am also helping University library to build a chat bot using microsoft Copilot Studio. I worked as a Software engineer for 2 years at Deloitte in ServiceNow team supporting ServiceNow implementations. Currenlty I am studying my Masters in Computer science. I love to code and explore new technologies. Recently I am reading about QML which is quite intruiging.-->
